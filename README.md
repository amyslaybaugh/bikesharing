## Summary: 
The analysis shows that men far outnumber women in the use of bikeshares in NYC.  It also shows that bikes are mostly used as a way to get to and from work.  Given the disparity in population density and traffic congestion I doubt the demand in Des Moines would correlate to NYC.  Two additional visualizations that could be useful would be comparing age and gender combined against time of day and distance traveled at specific times of day, i.e. to and from work hours.
